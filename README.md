With the continuous increase in the number of Covid-19 positive patients and suspects, it is becoming difficult for the clinicians to detect patients after taking their clinical tests. The current tests are mostly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It takes 4â€“6 hours to obtain results, which is a long time compared with the rapid spreading rate of COVID-19. Also, RT-PCR test kits are in huge shortage.

Here, we have come up with a solution to this problem. We have prepared a Web Application using which the early detection of Covid can be done.
The dataset has been taken from [here ](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)  , it contains chest X-rays of various patients. The model has been trained using tensorflow.

Please, go and check our simple WebApp :desktop_computer: [Covid-19 Early detection](http://covid19-early-detection.herokuapp.com/).
